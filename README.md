# kristyburge.github.io

I built this portfolio as my final project in the Treehouse Front End Developer Techdegree program. 

It's based on the Zurb Foundation framework along with custom JavaScript for interactivity. 

**JSON and API:** Load project details and contact information to fetch and display information from data files. 

**Smooth Scroll:** Used Foundation's Magellan to detect and update the section of the page in the navigation bar. 

**Modal:** Custom coded a pop-up modal to view project details. 

**Typed.js:** Used the Typed.js library to create the hero section introduction and make the site feel warm and friendly.
