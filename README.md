I built this portfolio as my final project in the Treehouse Front End Developer Techdegree program.

It's based on the Zurb Foundation framework along with custom JavaScript for interactivity.

**JSON and API calls:** Created JSON data files to store project details and make updating projects easier. Load project details and contact information dynamically with JavaScript and API calls to fetch and display information from data files.

**Smooth Scroll:** Used Foundation's Magellan JavaScript plugin to detect and update the section of the page in the navigation bar.

**Modal:** Custom coded a pop-up modal to view project details. The user can click the 'X' to close the modal or use the escape key. 

**To Top Button:** Used JavaScript to detect how far down the page a user scrolls before displaying button in bottom right corner that takes the user back to the top of the page.

**Typed.js:** Used the Typed.js library to create the hero section introduction and make the site feel warm and friendly.
